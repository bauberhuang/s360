# My journey to the success
I firstly found a 360 video and then my dad helped me to get the original looks. That it the coolist thing I've ever saw! After that I cut a screen shot and then made my first '360', it is just moves by using UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT! But I didn't stop here, I thought what if I just make all of the picels into a dictioanary?? After that I made pic.py (thanks ChatGPT) and video.py!
